          THE ORGANIAN PEACE TREATY HAS COLLAPSED,  AND THE FEDERATION
          IS  AT  WAR WITH  THE  KLINGON  EMPIRE,    AND YOU  ARE  THE
          COMMANDER  OF  THE  FLAGSHIP OF  THE  KLINGON  EMPIRE:   THE
          SUPERCOMMANDER KAZH, THE MIGHEST SHIP IN THE KNOWN GALAXY.

          YOUR BATTLEGROUND IS FEDERATION SPACE, WHICH FOR CONVENIENCE
          IS DIVIDED UP INTO EIGHT ROWS OF EIGHT QUADRANTS EACH,  LIKE
          A CHECKERBOARD.   ROWS ARE NUMBERED FROM TOP TO BOTTOM,  AND
          COLUMNS ARE NUMBERED LEFT TO RIGHT,  SO QUADRANT 1 - 8 WOULD
          BE IN THE UPPER RIGHT HAND CORNER OF THE GALAXY.

          DURING BATTLE YOU WILL BE CONCERNED ONLY WITH THOSE ENEMIES,
          THAT  IS  TO  SAY,  FEDERATION  STARBASES,   AND  FEDERATION
          STARSHIPS,   THAT  OCCUPY  THE SAME  QUADRANT  AS  YOURSELF.
          QUADRANTS  ARE DIVIDED  UP INTO  SECTORS,  TEN  ROWS OF  TEN
          SECTORS  EACH.   SECTORS  ARE NUMBERED  IN THE  SAME WAY  AS
          QUADRANTS, SO THE SECTOR IN THE UPPER RIGHT CORNER IS SECTOR
          1 - 10.   YOU HAVE A SHORT-RANGE SCANNER WHICH ALLOWS YOU TO
          LOOK AT THE ENTIRE QUADRANT IN A SINGLE DISPLAY.

          ENEMIES  RECHARGE DURING  YOUR  ABSENCE.    IF YOU  LEAVE  A
          QUADRANT CONTAINING  A WEAKENED ENEMY,   WHEN YOU  RETURN TO
          THAT QUADRANT HE WILL BE STRONG AGAIN.   ALSO, EACH TIME YOU
          ENTER  A  QUADRANT,   THE POSITIONS  OF  EVERYTHING  IN  THE
          QUADRANT (EXCEPT YOUR SHIP) ARE RANDOMIZED,  TO SAVE YOU THE
          TROUBLE  OF  TRYING  TO REMEMBER  WHERE  EVERYTHING  IN  THE
          QUADRANT IS.   NOTICE THAT THIS REFERS ONLY TO THE POSITIONS
          OF THINGS IN THE QUADRANT--THE NUMBERS OF EACH KIND OF THING
          ARE NOT CHANGED (EXCEPT BLACK HOLES)  IF YOU KILL SOMETHING,
          IT STAYS DEAD.

          THERE ARE TWO KINDS OF KLINGONS-  COMMANDERS,  AND YOURSELF,
          THE SUPER-COMMANDER KAZH,    THE COMMANDERS ARE NOT  QUITE A
          MATCH FOR A FEDERATION STARSHIP, BUT THEY CAN DO QUITE A BIT
          OF DAMAGE.

          YOUR  SHIP CONTAINS  THE MOST  ADVANCED KLINGON  ENGINEERING
          FEATURES, INCLUDING  A LONG  RANGE TRACTOR  BEAM,  AN  ANTI-
          PHOTON DEVICE, AND A DILITHIUM RE-ENERGIZER THAT CAN REFOCUS
          ENERGY FROM YOUR MAIN  ENERGY CELLS,  BACK INTO  THE MATTER-
          ANTIMATTER CONVERTERS  TO CREATE  ENERGY AT  A RATE  OF 1024
          UNITS/STARDATES,  RECHARGING YOUR SHIP.   THIS RECHARGING IS
          ESSENTIAL TO  YOUR POSSIBILITY OF  SUCCESS FOR YOU  AND YOUR
          STRIKE FORCE,  SINCE HOME IS TWO  WEEKS AWAY,  AND YOU CAN'T
          STOP ANYPLACE FOR ENERGY.

          THERE  IS YET  ANOTHER PROBLEM,   TOO,  YOU  DON'T HAVE  THE
          ELEMENT OF  SURPRISE FOREVER,   YOU MUST  BREAK THROUGH  THE

          FEDERATION DEFENSES,   AND DESTROY ALL STARBASES  BEFORE THE
          FEDERATION  HAS TIME  TO  MUSTER A  DEFENSE  TO YOUR  STRIKE
          FORCE, IN ABOUT 7 STARDATES.

          IN LIGHT OF THIS ENERGY SHORTAGE,  YOUR SHIP IS NOT EQUIPPED
          WITH  ANY KIND  OF ENERGY  WEAPONS,  SUCH  AS PHASERS,   BUT
          INSTEAD  IS   EQUIPPED  WITH  ULTRA  HIGH   POWER  DISRUPTOR
          TORPEDOES, EACH CONTAINING OVER TEN GRAMS OF ANTI-MATTER.

          IF YOU SUCCEED  IN YOUR MISSION,  WHICH IS NOT  AN EASY ONE,
          THEN MANY RICHES OF THE GALAXY  WILL BE YOURS,  AND YOU WILL
          HAVE COMPLETE CONTROL OVER ALL FEDERATION SPACE,  MAKING THE
          GALAXY SAFE FOR TREACHERY FOREVER.

          SPACE IS VAST,  AND IT TAKES  PRECIOUS TIME TO MOVE FROM ONE
          PLACE TO ANOTHER.    IN COMPARISON,  OTHER THINGS  HAPPEN SO
          QUICKLY THAT WE ASSUME THEY TAKE  NO TIME AT ALL.   TWO WAYS
          THAT TIME CAN PASS  ARE WHEN YOU MOVE,  OR WHEN  YOU ISSUE A
          COMMAND TO  SIT STILL AND REST  FOR A PERIOD OF  TIME.   YOU
          WILL SOMETIMES  WANT TO  DO THE  LATTER,  SINCE  THE VARIOUS
          DEVICES ABOARD YOUR STARSHIP MAY BE DAMAGED AND REQUIRE TIME
          TO REPAIR.

          IN ADDITION TO STARSHIPS AND STARBASES,  THE GALAXY CONTAINS
          (SURPRISE) STARS.  MOSTLY, STARS ARE A NUISANCE AND JUST GET
          IN YOUR WAY.  HOWEVER, STARS CAN BE VERY USEFUL WHEN NEXT TO
          AN INTENDED  TARGET,  AS THEY CAN  THEN BE MADE TO  GO NOVA,
          CAUSING HEAVY DAMAGE TO ANY  NEARBY SHIPS OR STARBASES.   IF
          ANOTHER STAR  IS ADJACENT TO A  NOVA,  IT TOO WILL  GO NOVA.
          STARS MAY ALSO OCCASIONALLY GO  SUPERNOVA;  A SUPERNOVA IN A
          QUADRANT DESTROYS EVERYTHING  IN THE QUADRANT AND  MAKES THE
          QUADRANT PERMANENTLY UNINHABITABLE.   YOU  MAY 'JUMP OVER' A
          QUADRANT  CONTAINING A  SUPERNOVA WHEN  YOU  MOVE,  BUT  YOU
          SHOULD NOT STOP THERE.

          SUPERNOVAS ARE A RARE NATURAL EVENT, THE MOST LIKELY WAY FOR
          A  STAR  TO  GO  SUPERNOVA IS  FOR  ONE  OF  YOUR  DISRUPTOR
          TORPEDOES TO SET IT OFF.  IN THE EVENT YOU DO SET OFF A STAR
          (10%)  AND IT GOES SUPERNOVA,   NAVIGATIONAL CONTROL OF YOUR
          SHIP WILL  BE TAKEN OVER BY  YOUR BATTLE COMPUTER,   AND YOU
          WILL BE  PILOTED OUT OF THE  QUADRANT,  PICKING AS  A TARGET
          QUADRANT, ONE OF THE FOLLOWING: (IN ORDER OF PREFERENCE)

               1.  THE NEAREST QUADRANT THAT DOES NOT CONTAIN AN ENEMY
               STARBASE OR STARSHIP.

               2.   A  QUADRANT SLIGHTLY  MORE DISTANT  THAT DOES  NOT
               CONTAIN AN ENEMY.

               3.  THE NEAREST QUADRANT TO WHICH THE PATH IS CLEAR.

               4.  ANY QUADRANT TO WHICH YOU CAN MOVE.

          IF YOUR  BATTLE COMPUTER  IS DAMAGED,  YOU  WILL BE  GIVEN A
          RANDOM COURSE TO A RANDOM NEARBY QUADRANT.

          ALSO A FEW PLANETS ARE SCATTERED THROUGH THE GALAXY.   THESE
          CAN BE VERY  HELPFUL,  AND YOU GET TIME BONUS  (WHICH CAN BE
          TURNED INTO ENERGY BY RESTING,   WHICH INCREASES YOUR ENERGY
          SUPPLY)   DEPENDING ON  THE BILLIONS  OF  PEOPLE KILLED  AND
          WHETHER  THE PLANET  HAD DILITHIUM  WHEN YOU  BLOW UP  THESE
          PLANETS.    PLANETS  CAN  BE  DETECTED  ON  THE  LONG  RANGE

          SCANNERS.

          FINALLY, EACH QUADRANT WILL CONTAIN FROM 0 TO 3 BLACK HOLES.
          THESE CAN  SWALLOW TORPEDOES PASSING  NEAR THEM.    THEY ARE
          JUST SOMETHING  TO GET  IN YOUR  WAY,  AND  SERVE NO  USEFUL
          PURPOSE.

                     ----------HOW TO ISSUE COMMANDS----------

          (IBM 327X TSO USERS SHOULD SEE  "APPENDIX T - NOTES FOR FULL
          SCREEN USERS")  WHEN THE GAME IS  WAITING FOR YOU TO ENTER A
          COMMAND, IT WILL PRINT OUT

                     COMMAND - ?

          YOU MAY THEN TYPE IN YOUR COMMAND.  ALL YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER
          FOR EACH COMMAND IS THE MNEMONIC.   FOR EXAMPLE, IF YOU WANT
          TO MOVE STRAIGHT  UP FOR ONE QUADRANT,  YOU CAN  TYPE IN THE
          MNEMONIC "MOVE"

          AND THE COMPUTER WILL PROMPT YOU WITH

                     MANUAL OR AUTOMATIC?

          SAY YOU TYPE IN 'MANUAL'.  THE COMPUTER THEN RESPONDS

                     X AND Y DISPLACEMENTS-

          NOW YOU TYPE  IN 0 1 WHICH  SPECIFIES AN X MOVEMENT  OF ZERO
          AND A Y MOVEMENT OF 1.

          WHEN YOU  HAVE LEARNED  THE COMMANDS,   YOU CAN  AVOID BEING
          PROMPTED BY SIMPLY TYPING IN THE INFORMATION WITHOUT WAITING
          TO BE ASKED FOR IT.   FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE ABOVE EXAMPLE, YOU
          COULD SIMPLY TYPE IN

                     MOVE MANUAL 0 1

          AND IT WILL BE DONE.  OR YOU COULD TYPE IN

                     MOVE MANUAL

          AND WHEN THE COMPUTER RESPONDS WITH

                     X AND Y DISPLACEMENTS-

          YOU CAN TYPE IN

                     0 1

          AND IT WILL UNDERSTAND.

          YOU CAN ABBREVIATE MOST MNEMONICS.   FOR 'MOVE', YOU CAN USE
          ANY OF

                     MOVE     MOV     MO     M

          SUCCESSFULLY.   FOR YOUR SAFETY,   CERTAIN CRITICAL COMMANDS
          (SUCH AS TO TERMINATE)  MUST BE WRITTEN OUT IN FULL.   ALSO,
          IN A  FEW CASES  TWO OR  MORE COMMANDS  BEGIN WITH  THE SAME
          LETTER,  AND IN THIS CASE THAT LETTER REFERS TO A PARTICULAR
          ONE OF THE  COMMANDS;  TO GET THE  OTHER,  YOUR ABBREVIATION
          MUST BE TWO OR MORE LETTERS LONG.   THIS SOUNDS COMPLICATED,
          BUT YOU WILL LEARN THE ABBREVIATIONS QUICKLY ENOUGH.

          WHAT THIS ALL BOILS DOWN TO IS-

               (1) YOU CAN ABBREVIATE PRACTICALLY ANYTHING,

               (2) IF YOU FORGET, THE COMPUTER WILL PROMPT YOU,

               (3) IF YOU REMEMBER, YOU CAN TYPE IT ALL ON ONE LINE.

          IF  YOU ARE  PART WAY  THROUGH  ENTERING A  COMMAND AND  YOU
          CHANGE YOUR MIND,  YOU CAN CANCEL THE COMMAND BY TYPING A -1
          AS ONE OF THE PARAMETERS,  WITH  THE EXCEPTION OF THE MANUAL
          MOVE COMMAND (TYPE X AND Y OF 0 0 TO CANCEL A MOVE MANUAL.)

          IF ANYTHING IS NOT CLEAR TO YOU, EXPERIMENT.   THE WORST YOU
          CAN DO IS LOSE A GAME OR TWO.

          LIKE ALL KLINGON COMMANDERS,  YOUR  SHIP IS EQUIPPED WITH AN
          ANTI-PHOTON DEVICE.  THIS A.P.D.   WILL PROTECT YOU FROM ONE
          ROUND  OF  FEDERATION  PHOTON TORPEDOES  (3.)    THE  A.P.D.
          REQUIRES 500  UNITS OF SHIELD  ENERGY TO ACTIVATE  IT.   TWO
          THINGS CAN DISARM THE ANTI-PHOTON DEVICE,  1.   IT ABSORBS A
          FULL ROUND OF TORPEDOES OR  2.   A FEDERATION STARSHIP FIRES
          PHASERS  AT YOU  (THE  A.P.D.  IS  RUN  BY  THE SHIP'S  MAIN
          COMPUTER,   NOT THE  BATTLE COMPUTER,   AND AS  SUCH IS  NOT
          AFFECTED WHEN THE BATTLE COMPUTER IS DAMAGED AND CAN BE USED
          EVEN IF YOUR SHIELDS ARE DOWN.)

          THE USE OF THE  ANTI PHOTON DEVICE DOES NOT COUNT  AS A TURN
          AND CAN BE ACTIVATED INSTANTLY,   EVEN DURING BATTLE,  AT NO
          COST IN TIME, AND DOES NOT ALLOW ENEMIES TO ATTACK.

          AS YOU PROCEED  IN THE GAME,  YOU LEARN MORE  AND MORE ABOUT
          WHAT THINGS ARE  WHERE IN THE GALAXY.    THIS INFORMATION IS
          AUTOMATICALLY RECORDED FOR YOU IN YOUR STAR CHART.

          THE CHART  LOOKS LIKE AN  8 BY  8 ARRAY OF  NUMBERS.   THESE
          NUMBERS ARE INTERPRETED EXACTLY AS  THEY ARE ON A LONG-RANGE
          SCAN.   A PERIOD (.)   IN PLACE OF A DIGIT MEANS  YOU DO NOT
          KNOW THAT INFORMATION YET.  FOR EXAMPLE, ...  MEANS YOU KNOW
          NOTHING ABOUT THE QUADRANT.

          LOOKING AT THE STAR CHART IS A FREE OPERATION.  IT COSTS YOU
          NEITHER TIME NOR ENERGY,  AND CAN  BE DONE SAFELY WHETHER IN
          OR OUT OF BATTLE.

          YOUR DEFLECTOR SHIELDS ARE A DEFENSIVE DEVICE TO PROTECT YOU
          FROM FEDERATION ATTACKS (AND NEARBY NOVAS).   AS THE SHIELDS
          PROTECT YOU, THEY GRADUALLY WEAKEN.  A SHIELD STRENGTH OF 75
          PERCENT,  FOR  EXAMPLE,  MEANS  THAT THE  NEXT TIME  YOU ARE
          ATTACKED,  YOUR SHIELDS WILL DEFLECT  75 PERCENT OF THE HIT,
          AND LET 25 PERCENT GET THROUGH TO HURT YOU.

          IT COSTS  50 UNITS OF ENERGY  TO RAISE SHIELDS,   NOTHING TO
          LOWER THEM.

          YOU SHOULD NEVER HAVE TO RAISE OR LOWER SHIELDS MANUALLY, AS
          YOUR AUTOMATIC  DEFLECTOR SCREEN  CONTROL WILL  DO THIS  FOR
          YOU, AS YOU GO INTO BATTLE, AND LEAVE BATTLE.

          YOU MAY TRANSFER ENERGY BETWEEN  THE SHIP'S ENERGY (GIVEN AS
          (ENERGY)  IN STATUS)  AND THE  SHIELDS.   (TRANSFER)  MAY BE
          ABBREVIATED (T).    (AMOUNT OF ENERGY  TO TRANSFER)   IS THE
          NUMBER OF UNITS  OF ENERGY YOU WISH TO TAKE  FROM THE SHIP'S
          ENERGY AND PUT INTO THE SHIELDS.   IF YOU SPECIFY A NEGATIVE
          NUMBER,  ENERGY  IS DRAINED  FROM THE  SHIELDS TO  THE SHIP.
          TRANSFERRING ENERGY  CONSTITUTES A  TURN.   IF  YOU TRANSFER
          ENERGY TO THE  SHIELDS WHILE UNDER ATTACK,  THEY  WILL BE AT
          THE NEW ENERGY LEVEL WHEN YOU ARE NEXT HIT.

          ENEMY TORPEDOES  HITTING YOUR SHIP  EXPLODE ON  YOUR SHIELDS
          (IF THEY  ARE UP)  AND HAVE  ESSENTIALLY THE SAME  EFFECT AS
          PHASER HITS.

          DISRUPTOR TORPEDOES  ARE PROJECTILE WEAPONS--YOU  EITHER HIT
          WHAT YOU AIM AT, OR YOU DON'T.  THERE ARE NO 'PARTIAL HITS'.

          YOU MAY FIRE DISRUPTOR TORPEDOES SINGLY, OR IN BURSTS OF TWO
          THREE OR  FOUR.   EACH  TORPEDO IS  INDIVIDUALLY TARGETABLE.
          THE COMPUTER WILL PROMPT YOU,   ASKING FOR THE TARGET SECTOR
          FOR EACH TORPEDO.   ALTERNATELY, YOU MAY SPECIFY EACH TARGET
          IN THE COMMAND LINE.

          IF MORE THAN ONE TORPEDO IS FIRED AND ONLY ONE TARGET SECTOR
          IS SPECIFIED,  ALL TORPEDOES ARE FIRED AT THAT SECTOR.   FOR
          EXAMPLE, TO FIRE TWO TORPEDOES AT SECTOR 3 - 4, YOU TYPE

          THERE IS NO RESTRICTION TO FIRE  DIRECTLY AT A SECTOR.   FOR
          EXAMPLE, YOU CAN ENTER:

          TORPEDOES  GOING WITHIN  0.5  SECTORS OF  A  BLACK HOLE  ARE
          SWALLOWED.  IF YOUR DISRUPTOR TORPEDO TUBES ARE DAMAGED LESS
          THAN 3 STARDATES, YOU CAN STILL FIRE 2 TORPEDOES (INSTEAD OF
          4)

          THE PURPOSE OF THE (FREEZE)  COMMAND IS TO ALLOW A PLAYER TO
          SAVE  THE CURRENT  STATE OF  THE GAME,   SO THAT  IT CAN  BE
          FINISHED LATER.  ALL PERTINANT INFORMATION ABOUT THE GAME IS
          WRITTEN TO A FREEZE FILE,  SAVED  ON THE USERS CATALOG,  AND
          THE GAME STOPS.

          TO RESTART A GAME CREATED BY THE 'FREEZE' COMMAND,  THE USER
          NEED ONLY  TYPE 'OLD'  IN RESPONSE  TO THE  INITIAL QUESTION
          ABOUT THE TYPE OF GAME DESIRED, FOLLOWED BY THE (FILE NAME).

          NOTE-  A 'TOURNAMENT' GAME IS LIKE  A FROZEN GAME,  WITH THE
          FOLLOWING DIFFERENCES.   (1)   TOURNAMENT GAMES ALWAYS START
          FROM THE  BEGINNING,  WHILE A FROZEN  GAME CAN START  AT ANY
          POINT.   (2)   TOURNAMENT GAMES REQUIRE ONLY THAT THE PLAYER
          REMEMBER THE  NAME OR NUMBER  OF THE TOURNAMENT,   WHILE THE
          INFORMATION ABOUT A FROZEN GAME MUST BE KEPT ON A FILE.

          A LONG-RANGE SCAN GIVES YOU  GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT WHERE
          YOU ARE AND WHAT IS AROUND YOU.  HERE IS AN EXAMPLE OUTPUT.

            LONG RANGE SCAN FOR AREA:  1 - 4

            PLANET DETECTED IN QUADRANT:  2 - 5

          THIS SCAN SAYS THAT YOU ARE IN ROW 1, COLUMN 4 OF THE 8 BY 8
          GALAXY.   THE NUMBERS IN THE SCAN  INDICATE HOW MANY OF EACH
          KIND OF  THING THERE  IS IN YOUR  QUADRANT AND  ALL ADJACENT
          QUADRANTS.  THE DIGITS ARE INTERPRETED AS FOLLOWS.

              THOUSANDS DIGIT-  1000 INDICATES A KLINGON COMMANDER
              HUNDREDS DIGIT-   NUMBER OF FEDERATION STARSHIPS
              TENS DIGIT-       NUMBER OF STARBASES PRESENT
              ONES DIGIT-       NUMBER OF STARS PRESENT
              9999      -       INDICATES SUPERNOVA
              ****      -       EDGE OF FEDERATION SPACE.

          FOR EXAMPLE, IN YOUR QUADRANT (1 - 4) THE NUMBER IS 2, WHICH
          INDICATES 2 STARS, YOU,  AND NOTHING ELSE (YOU ARE ALWAYS IN
          THE CENTER QUADRANT OF THESE SCANS.)   THERE IS A FEDERATION
          STARSHIP IN  QUADRANT 1  - 3 (102),   A COMMANDER  AND SEVEN
          STARS IN QUADRANT 2 - 3 (1007),  A SUPERNOVA IN QUADRANT 1 -
          5 (9999) AND A STARBASE, AND NINE STARS IN 2 - 5 (19)

          YOU MIGHT ALSO NOTICE A REPORT ON A PLANET IN QUADRANT 2 - 5
          UNLIKE SUPER STAR TREK, PLANETS ARE DETECTABLE BY LONG RANGE
          SCAN, SO THAT IF THEY ARE IN YOUR FLIGHT PATH,  YOU CAN STOP
          AND KILL IT IF YOU WISH.

          SINCE YOU ARE  IN ROW 1,  THERE ARE NO  QUADRANTS ABOVE YOU.
          THE  ****'S INDICATE  THE THE  BORDER  OF FEDERATION  SPACE,
          WHICH YOU ARE NOT PERMITTED TO CROSS.

              FULL COMMAND-  MOVE MANUAL (DISPLACEMENT)
                             MOVE AUTOMATIC (DESTINATION)

          THIS COMMAND  IS THE  USUAL WAY  TO MOVE  FROM ONE  PLACE TO
          ANOTHER  WITHIN THE  GALAXY.   YOU  MOVE  UNDER WARP  DRIVE,
          ACCORDING TO THE CURRENT WARP FACTOR (SEE 'WARP FACTOR').

          THERE  ARE  TWO  COMMAND MODES  FOR  MOVEMENT;   MANUAL  AND
          AUTOMATIC.  THE MANUAL MODE REQUIRES THE FOLLOWING FORMAT-

                   MOVE MANUAL (DELTX),(DELTY)

          (DELTX)   AND  (DELTY)   ARE  THE  HORIZONTAL  AND  VERTICAL
          DISPLACEMENTS   FOR  YOUR   STARSHIP,    IN  QUADRANTS;    A
          DISPLACEMENT OF  ONE SECTOR  IS 0.1  QUADRANTS.   SPECIFYING
          (DELTX)  AND (DELTY)  CAUSES YOUR SHIP TO MOVE IN A STRAIGHT
          LINE TO THE SPECIFIED DESTINATION.   IF (DELTY)  IS OMITTED,
          IT IS  ASSUMED ZERO.   FOR  EXAMPLE,  THE  SHORTEST POSSIBLE
          COMMAND TO MOVE 1 SECTOR TO THE RIGHT WOULD BE

                   M M .1

          THE  FOLLOWING EXAMPLES  OF  MANUAL  MOVEMENT REFER  TO  THE
          SHORT-RANGE SCAN EXAMPLE.

              DESTINATION SECTOR      MANUAL MOVEMENT COMMAND

                    3 - 1                    M M -.3 .1

                    4 - 10                   M M .6
                    6 - 6                    M M .2 -.2
                    5 - 4                    M M 0 -.1

          THE AUTOMATIC MODE IS AS FOLLOWS-

                   MOVE AUTOMATIC (QROW),(QCOL),(SROW),(SCOL)

          WHERE (QROW)  AND (QCOL)  ARE THE  ROW AND COLUMN NUMBERS OF

          THE DESTINATION QUADRANT, AND (SROW) AND (SCOL)  ARE THE ROW
          AND COLUMN  NUMBERS OF  THE DESTINATION  SECTOR WITHIN  THAT
          QUADRANT.   THIS COMMAND ALSO MOVES  YOUR SHIP IN A STRAIGHT
          LINE PATH TO THE DESTINATION.  FOR MOVING WITHIN A QUADRANT,
          (QROW) AND (QCOL) MAY BE OMITTED.   FOR EXAMPLE,  TO MOVE TO
          SECTOR 2 - 9 IN THE  CURRENT QUADRANT,  THE SHORTEST COMMAND
          WOULD BE

                   M A 2 9

          TO MOVE TO QUADRANT 3 - 7, SECTOR 5 - 8, TYPE

                   M A 3 7 5 8

          AND IT WILL BE DONE.   IN AUTOMATIC MODE, EITHER TWO OR FOUR
          NUMBERS MUST BE SUPPLIED.

          AUTOMATIC MODE  UTILIZES THE SHIP'S 'BATTLE  COMPUTER'.   IF
          THE COMPUTER IS DAMAGED, MANUAL MOVEMENT MUST BE USED.

          IF WARP  ENGINES ARE DAMAGED LESS  THAN 5 STARDATES  YOU CAN
          STILL GO WARP FIVE.

          IT USES TIME AND ENERGY TO MOVE.  HOW MUCH TIME AND HOW MUCH
          ENERGY DEPENDS ON YOUR CURRENT  WARP FACTOR AND THE DISTANCE
          YOU MOVE.   THE HIGHER THE WARP FACTOR, THE FASTER YOU MOVE,
          AND THE MORE ENERGY YOU USE,   BUT THE WARP ENGINES ARE MORE
          EFFICIENT AT HIGH SPEEDS.

          IN OTHER  WORDS,  TO GET  THERE TWICE  AS FAST DOES  NOT USE
          TWICE AS MUCH ENERGY.

          THE SUGGESTED  WARP SPEED  IS WARP  10,  THE  FASTEST "SAFE"
          SPEED.

          SHORT-RANGE SCANS ARE FREE.   THAT IS, THEY USE UP NO ENERGY
          AND NO TIME.  IF YOU ARE IN BATTLE, DOING A SHORT-RANGE SCAN
          DOES NOT GIVE  THE ENEMIES ANOTHER CHANCE TO  HIT YOU.   YOU
          CAN SAFELY DO A SHORT-RANGE SCAN ANYTIME YOU LIKE.

          (TSO 327X USERS SHOULD REFER TO APPENDIX T - NOTES FOR TSO FULLSCREEN
          USERS)

          THIS COMMAND GIVES  YOU INFORMATION ABOUT THE  CURRENT STATE
          OF YOUR STARSHIP, AS FOLLOWS-

                    STARDATE - THE  CURRENT DATE.   A STARDATE  IS THE
                    SAME AS A DAY.

                    CONDITION - THERE ARE FOUR POSSIBLE CONDITIONS-

                         RED    - IN BATTLE.
                         YELLOW - LOW ON ENERGY (0/1000 UNITS).
                         GREEN  - NONE OF THE ABOVE.

                    POSITION - QUADRANT IS GIVEN FIRST, THEN SECTOR.

                    FEDERATION    -  GIVES  THE NUMBERS  ON  HOW  MANY
                    STARSHIPS   AND  STARSHIPS   ARE   LEFT  FOR   THE
                    FEDERATION

                    WARP FACTOR -  WHAT YOUR WARP FACTOR  IS CURRENTLY
                    SET TO.

                    ENERGY - THE AMOUNT OF  ENERGY YOU HAVE LEFT.   IF
                    IT  DROPS TO  ZERO,  ONE  DOSE OF  750.0 UNITS  OF
                    ENERGY WILL BE TAKEN FROM YOUR BATTERIES, PROVIDED
                    YOUR BATTLE COMPUTER IS WORKING, AND THE BATTERIES
                    ARE CHARGED.

                    TORPEDOES - HOW MANY  DISRUPTOR TORPEDOES YOU HAVE
                    LEFT.    ALSO  TELLS  WHAT   THE  STATUS  OF  YOUR
                    DISRUPTOR TORPEDO TUBES ARE.

                         OUT - NO TORPEDOES LEFT,
                         READY - TORPEDOES STANDING BY TO FIRE
                         DAMAGED - TORPEDO TUBES ARE DAMAGED.

                    SHIELDS - WHETHER YOUR SHIELDS ARE UP OR DOWN, HOW
                    STRONG THEY  ARE (WHAT PERCENT  OF A HIT  THEY CAN
                    DEFLECT), AND SHIELD ENERGY.

                    KLINGON   -  HOW MANY OF  YOUR FRIENDLY  SHIPS ARE
                    OUT THERE.

                    REMAINING  -  HOW  LONG  YOU  HAVE  TO  CRUSH  THE
                    FEDERATION  IF IT  REACHES  ZERO,  THE  FEDERATION
                    WINS, AND YOU WILL THEN BE OPENING SEALED ORDERS.

          STATUS INFORMATION IS FREE--IT USES  NO TIME OR ENERGY,  AND
          IF YOU ARE  IN BATTLE,  THE FEDERATION IS  NOT GIVEN ANOTHER
          CHANCE TO HIT YOU.

          SHORTEST ABBREVIATION- TRAC
          FULL COMMAND-  TRACTOR (TARGET QUADRANT)

          THE TRACTOR  COMMAND ALLOWS YOU TO  PULL A SHIP  ACROSS SOME
          DISTANCE IN SPACE.   WHEN THIS COMMAND IS ISSUED YOU WILL BE
          PROMPTED WITH THE  AMOUNT OF ENERGY IT WOULD TAKE  TO PULL A
          SHIP THAT  FAR,  AND ASKED IF  YOU STILL WISH TO  ENGAGE THE
          TRACTOR BEAM,   IF A SHIP IS FOUND AT THE TARGET QUADRANT IT
          WILL BE PULLED TO YOUR QUADRANT.   IF THERE IS MORE THAN ONE
          AT THE TARGET QUADRANT, ONE WILL BE SELECTED RANDOMLY.

          IF THERE  IS NO SHIP  AT THE  TARGET QUADRANT,  YOU  WILL BE
          NOTIFIED OF  THIS FACT,  AND THE  POWER DRAIN CAUSED  BY THE
          TRACTOR BEAM WILL BE CUT BY 50%

          IT IS POSSIBLE TO TRACTOR EITHER  COMMANDERS (TO HELP OUT IN
          A  FIGHT PERHAPS)    OR  FEDERATION STARSHIPS,    STARBASES,
          PLANETS,  STARS,   AND BLACK HOLES  ARE NOT EFFECTED  BY THE
          TRACTORS.

          THE USE OF THE TRACTOR BEAM CONSTITUTES A TURN,  AND ENEMIES
          WILL ATTACK.

          YOUR WARP FACTOR CONTROLS THE  SPEED OF YOUR STARSHIP.   THE
          LARGER THE  WARP FACTOR,   THE FASTER  YOU GO  AND THE  MORE
          ENERGY YOU USE.

          YOUR MINIMUM WARP FACTOR IS 1.0 AND YOUR MAXIMUM WARP FACTOR
          IS 12.0.   AT  SPEEDS ABOVE WARP 10 THERE IS  SOME DANGER OF
          CAUSING DAMAGE TO YOUR WARP  ENGINES;  THIS DAMAGE IS LARGER
          AT HIGHER WARP FACTORS AND ALSO DEPENDS ON HOW FAR YOU GO AT
          THAT WARP FACTOR.

          The Extended debugging  feature is used (under  advisment of
          the user  maintaining the  game program)   to provide  trace
          information on routine flow.

          If  you enter  this command  by mistake,   enter any  random
          password,   the program  will then  reject  the command  and
          proceed with play.

                        ----------MISCELLANEOUS NOTES----------

          IF A  FEDERATION STARBASE  OR PLANET  IS ATTACKED,   BUT NOT
          DESTROYED (AND THERE IS ANYONE ALIVE TO DO IT,)   A SUBSPACE
          RADIO CALL  ON THE STAR FLEET  PRIORITY ONE CHANNEL  WILL GO
          OUT,  MEANING  THAT IF  THERE ARE  ANY FEDERATION  STARSHIPS
          NEARBY, YOU WILL SOON HAVE LOTS OF COMPANY...

          BLACK HOLES MOVE ABOUT, RANDOMLY.

          THE TYPE OF DISRUPTOR TORPEDOES YOU CARRY HAVE BEEN KNOWN TO
          EXPLODE IN THE FIRING TUBE, BUT THAT IS RATHER RARE.

          WHEN HITS ARE SHOT AT THE  SUPPERCOMMANDER KAZH,  THE HIT IS
          SHOWN AS TWO NUMBERS, EXAMPLE:

          (112,1832)  UNIT HIT FROM FEDERATION STARSHIP AT 1 - 1

          THIS MEANS THAT YOUR SHIELDS  ABSORBED 1832 UNITS,  AND YOUR
          SHIP GOT HIT WITH 112 UNITS.

                              ----------SCORING----------

          SCORING IS FAIRLY SIMPLE.   YOU  GET POINTS FOR GOOD THINGS,
          AND YOU LOSE POINTS FOR BAD THINGS.

          YOU GAIN--

             (1)  200 POINTS FOR EACH FEDERATION STARBASE
             (2)  100 POINTS FOR EACH FEDERATION STARSHIP YOU DESTROY
             (3)  YOU GET A WIN BONUS BASED ON YOUR SKILL LEVEL,
                  10000-GOOD, 20000-EXPERT, 30000-EMERITUS
             (4)  A SPECIAL WIN BONUS FOR TIME REMAINING.
             (5)  A PROMOTION TO THE NEXT LEVEL, FOR ANY WIN.
             (6)  A POINT BONUS FOR BILLIONS OF PEOPLE KILLED
                  ON PLANETS, AND AN EXTRA BONUS FOR DILITHIUM.

          YOU LOSE:

             (7)  75 POINTS FOR EACH COMMANDER DESTROYED.
             (8)  1000 POINTS IF YOU GET YOURSELF KILLED.

          YOU CAN  BE PROMOTED  FROM ANY LEVEL.    THERE IS  A SPECIAL
          PROMOTION AVAILABLE  IF YOU  GO BEYOND  THE 'EXPERT'  RANGE.
          YOU CAN ALSO  HAVE A CERTIFICATE OF MERIT  PRINTED WITH YOUR
          NAME,  AND  DATE PROVIDED YOU  ARE PROMOTED FROM  EITHER THE
          'EXPERT' OR 'EMERITUS' LEVELS.

          YOU SHOULD PROBABLY START OUT AT THE GOOD LEVEL, EVEN IF YOU
          ARE ALREADY FAMILIAR  WITH ONE OF THE OTHER  VERSIONS OF THE
          STAR TREK GAME--BUT,  OF COURSE,  THE LEVEL OF GAME YOU PLAY
          IS UP TO YOU.   IF YOU WANT TO START AT THE EXPERT LEVEL, GO
          AHEAD.  IT'S YOUR FUNERAL.   THE EMERITUS GAME IS CONSIDERED
          IMPOSSIBLE BY SOME  (ALTHOUGH IT IS RUMORED  THAT THE AUTHOR
          WINS ABOUT 10 PERCENT OF THE TIME)

          IS 0.1  QUADRANT.   STARBASES  REQUIRE 4  TO 6  TORPEDOES TO
          KILL,  WHILE  A FEDERATION REQUIRES  2-4 TORPEDOES  TO KILL,
          AND  PLANETS  ANYWHERE  FROM   1-4  TORPEDOES  DEPENDING  ON
          POPULATION AND PRESENCE OF DILITHIUM.

          WARP 10 IS THE FASTEST SAFE SPEED.  AT HIGHER SPEEDS, ENGINE
          DAMAGE MAY OCCUR.  SHIELDS COST 50 UNITS OF ENERGY TO RAISE.

                      Appendix T - Notes for TSO 3270 users

          For TSO 3270  users,  KLINGON is a  full screen application.
          the major differences are:

          The SRSCAN, LRSCAN,  and STATUS commands cannot be explictly
          entered,  since  this information  is on  the screen  at all
          times.

          The format of the screen is:


              ...........  ++++++++++   LRSCAN
              ...........  ++++++++++   and
              ... SRS ...  + status +
              ...........  ++ info ++   PLANET
              ...........  ++++++++++   info

          SRS and STATUS - the format  of this information is the same
          as the standard version.

          The LRSCAN and  PLANET information is the  same as described
          in the LRSCAN command, however, the information is presented
          in a "compressed" form,  to allow  for the smaller amount of
          space available on the screen
